    "### int\n",
    "- The 32-bit integer supports values between **−2 147 483 648** and **2 147 483 647**, roughly equal to ± $2×10^9$\n",
    "- The 64-bit long type supports values between **-9,223,372,036,854,775,808** to **9,223,372,036,854,775,807**, roughly as ± $9×10^{18}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### decimal (float/double)\n",
    "It is important to know that floating point numbers are **not** exact, because the binary architecture of computers can only store decimals to a certain precision. Hence, we should always expect that floating point numbers are slightly off. Contest problems will mark as correct any output that is within a certain range of the judge’s answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### boolean\n",
    "In Java, it's a strict type of data. In C/C++/Python, there are rules for other type values when they used as a \"boolean\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### char\n",
    "Remember they can be calculated by +, -, *, /; Please refer to the ASCII table below for specific values\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../img/ascii-table.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### String\n",
    "Strings are effectively arrays of characters. Most time you need this to access the character at a certain index and take substrings of the string."
