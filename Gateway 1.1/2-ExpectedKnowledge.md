# Data Types
---

### int
The 32-bit integer supports values between **−2 147 483 648** and **2 147 483 647**, which is roughly equal to ± $2×10^9$

### decimal (float/double)
It is important to know that floating point numbers are **not** exact, because the binary architecture of computers can only store decimals to a certain precision. Hence, we should always expect that floating point numbers are slightly off.

Contest problems will mark as correct any output that is within a certain range of the judge’s answer.

### boolean
In Java, it's a strict type of data. In C/C++/Python, there are rules for other type values when they used as a "boolean".

### char
Remember they can be calculated by +, -, *, /; Please refer to the ASCII table below for specific values

### String
Strings are effectively arrays of characters. Most time you need this to access the character at a certain index and take substrings of the string.
